Meet my family.
First, meet my mum and dad, Jane and Michael.
My mum is slim and rather tall. She has long red hair and big brown eyes.
She is a housewife. As she has three children,
who is only three months old. My sister is very small and funny. She sleeps,
reads a book or just watches TV. My father is a doctor. He is tall and
is rather strict with us, but always fair. My elder brother Ken is thirteen, and he
hardly understand all these sums and problems. Ken has red hair and brown eyes.
as my brother, though I try to do my best at school too. I am fond of dancing.
I am very proud of it. I also like to help my mother with my little sister very much.
